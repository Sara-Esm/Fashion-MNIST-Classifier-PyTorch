# Fashion-MNIST-Classifier-PyTorch

## Overview

This project focuses on building an image classification system using PyTorch. Leveraging a pre-trained ResNet-50 model from ImageNet, the system is fine-tuned to perform on the MiniPlaces dataset. The implementation covers crucial aspects like datasets, dataloaders, loss functions, optimizers, data augmentation, and the training loop.


## Key Objectives

1. **Utilize Pre-trained Models:** Leverage the power of pre-trained ResNet-50 models on ImageNet for enhanced performance.

2. **Fine-tune on MiniPlaces Dataset:** Adapt the model to the specific characteristics of the MiniPlaces dataset for accurate image classification.

3. **Comprehensive PyTorch Concepts:** Implement fundamental PyTorch concepts, including datasets, dataloaders, loss functions, and optimizers.
